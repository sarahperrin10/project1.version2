### The Duke Dunking Challenge
![Sarah Perrin](images/screenshot.png?raw=true "Sarah Perrin")

I have expanded on my first 'Hello World' sketch to try to more clearly communicate my ideas about the culture of Duke basketball: though the fanfare may appear to be so intertwined with the game itself, at times it can take away from the fundamentals of the movement of the player or the ball. In this sketch, I made the background more overwhelming by constantly changing the background color of my canvas, emitting the sound of a crowd cheering in the background, and moving various Duke basketball "symbols" quickly across the screen.

The purpose of this is, again, to show how consuming and even distracting the culture of a sport can be, compared to the game itself. To further this point, if the user clicks his/her mouse the canvas goes entirely black except for the player, the ball, and the hoop. This is how I imagine "tunnel vision" must be for some players when they drown out the crowd and focus on the reason why they got into their profession in the first place: for the sport alone.
