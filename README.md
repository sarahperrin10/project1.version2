### The Duke Dunking Challenge

I have expanded on my first hello world sketch to further get at my idea about the culture of Duke basketball. In this sketch, I made the background more overwhelming by constantly changing the background color of the canvas, having the sound of a crowd cheering in the background, and have my images moving quickly along the border.

The purpose of this is, again, to show how consuming and even distracting the culture of a sport can be, compared to the game itself. To further this point, if the user clicks his/her mouse the canvas goes entirely black except for the player, the ball, and the hoop. This is how I imagine "tunnel vision" must be for some players when they must drown out the crowd and focus on the reason they got into their profession: for the sport alone.
